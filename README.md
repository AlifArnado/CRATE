----------

The editor is accessible [here](http://chat-wane.github.io/CRATE). You can
already start editing. When you want to join someone's authoring session, you
must follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Click on "Network" > "Create ticket".</li> 
  <li>At the bottom of the page, a link will appear. Copy and send it to your
  friend.</li>
<ol>
Afterward, your friend must:
<ol>
  <li>Copy/paste the link into "Network" > "Stamp ticket".</li>
  <li>Once again, a link will appear at the bottom of the page. He must copy
  and send it back to you.</li>
</ol>
Finally, once you get the link back you must:
<ol>
  <li>Copy/paste the link into "Network" > "Confirm arrival". The planet near
  the "Network" button should go from red to green once you are connected.</li>
</ol>
